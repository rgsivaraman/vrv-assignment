## **How to Add Components**

### **Adding a New UI Component**
1. Create the component inside `src/components/ui/` (e.g., `src/components/ui/MyComponent.js`).
2. Export the component in the `index.js` file:
   ```javascript
   export { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';
   ```
3. Use it anywhere in the app:
   ```javascript
   import { MyComponent } from '@/components/ui';
   ```

## **Customization**

### **Styling**
The project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. You can modify the Tailwind configuration in the `tailwind.config.js` file if needed.

### **Adding or Editing Permissions**
Permissions are defined in the `permissions` array inside the `RBACDashboard` component:
```javascript
const permissions = [
  "create_user",
  "edit_user",
  "delete_user",
  "manage_roles",
];
```
You can extend or modify this array as needed.

---

## **Future Improvements**

- **Backend Integration**
  - Replace mock data with an API.
  - Connect to a database for persistent storage.

- **Enhanced Validation**
  - Add form validation for adding/editing users and roles.

- **Role Assignment**
  - Allow assigning multiple roles to a single user.
